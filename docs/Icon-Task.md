# Siren icon and splash screen

Siren is an intuitive tempo-based music library, which through the use of intelligent learning, delivers mood-based tunes to listeners.

Siren AI provides audio experience for proper audience at proper time of the day. The main goal is to stream audio experience relevant to audio profile. Music player passes the profile which consists of different preferences regarding time of the day, genres, tempo etc. Based on user's profile Siren AI should generate relevant audio track to support the mood. Ideally the track should seamlessly play the next song once the current is going to finish.

## Conceptual Design

- The app icon should feature an image that distinctly portrays the Siren character from Greek mythology but also an AI impression. It should be a mix modern and ancient.
- The icon must be visually appealing to attract users and convey the purpose of the app quickly.
- In additional to the app icon splash screen design should be provided.

## Technical Requirements

- The app icon should be created in the compatible image files formats (such as PNG or SVG). SVG format is preferable.
- Once icon created not in SVG it should meet the specific size and resolution requirements for each supported platform (iOS, Android, Web)

## Typography

- Choose a font that is legible and reflects the musical aspect of the app.
Shape and Symbolism:
- Use shapes or symbols that convey the idea of music and AI, such as a musical note or a futuristic image.

## Animation or Movement

- Usually app splash screen allows for animation, consider adding movement or animation elements to make it more engaging.
Branding Elements:
- Its better to design company logo first and create app icon based on company's branding elements, such as a logo or specific color palette.
